[Sunbytes] Assignment for Magento Developer position
===

## Task Description

>With the assignment we immediately frame the Backend, API and Frontend.
We would like to see a simple CRUD module that works with UI components. The module should be in the backend only.
The module must be able to be retrieved via the frontend API. It should be accessible in the rest API with anonymous access.
Optionally, the assignment can be expanded with a frontend widget in which we can select a record that can be injected onto a CMS page. The optional part is referring to to the widget that can be inserted in an HTML code element on a CMS Block or a CMS Page
